JavaScript is a versatile language, widely used both on the client and server sides. One of its most powerful environments is Node, which allows developers to run JavaScript outside the browser. Many companies choose Node for building scalable network applications. The Node ecosystem includes npm, a massive collection of packages that speed up development. With Node, handling asynchronous operations becomes easier using callbacks, promises, and async/await. Overall, Node has revolutionized backend development by making JavaScript a full-stack language.
